# Exploitation

Program exploitation is the staple of hacking. a program is made up of a complex set of rules following a certain execution flow that ultimately tells the computer what to do.
Exploiting a program is simply a clever way of getting the computer to do what you want it to do, even if the currently running program was designed to prevent that action.
