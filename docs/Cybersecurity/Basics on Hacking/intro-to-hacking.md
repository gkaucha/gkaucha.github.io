# Intro to Hacking


Hacker is a term for both those who write code and those who exploit it. Hacking is really just the act of finding a clever and counterintuitive
solution to a problem.

There are actually an infinite number of programs that can be written to accomplish any given task, but most of these solutions are unnecessarily large, complex, and sloppy. The few solutions that remain are small, efficient, and neat. Programs that have these qualities are said to have elegance, and the clever and inventive solutions that tend to lead to this efficiency are called hacks.
