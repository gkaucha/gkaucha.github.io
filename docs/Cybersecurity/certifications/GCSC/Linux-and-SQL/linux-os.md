# Linux OS

 A request to complete a task starts with the user and then flows through applications, the shell, the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, the kernel, and the hardware.


## Linux architecture


- **User**  
  Linux is a multi-user system, which means that multiple users can use the same resources at the same time.

- **Application**  
  An application is a program that performs a specific task.In Linux, you'll often use a package manager to install applications. A package manager is a tool that helps users install, manage, and remove packages or applications. A package is a piece of software that can be combined with other packages to form an application.

- **Shell**  
  The shell is the command-line interpreter. The shell allows users to give commands to the kernel and receive responses from it.

- **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard(FHS)**  
  The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is the component of the Linux OS that organizes data. It specifies the location where data is stored in the operating system.   
  A directory is a file that organizes where other files are stored. The FHS defines how directories, directory contents, and other storage is organized so the operating system knows where to find specific data. 

- **Kernel**  
  The kernel is the component of the Linux OS that manages processes and memory. It communicates with the applications to route commands. It is critical for allocating resources in the system. The kernel controls all major functions of the hardware, which can help get tasks expedited more efficiently.

- **Hardware**  
  The hardware is the physical components of a computer. Examples are CPUs or hard drives.  

  **Peripheral devices** are hardware components that are attached and controlled by the computer system. Examples include monitors, printers, the keyboard, and the mouse.

  **Internal hardware** are the components required to run the computer. It includes a main circuit board and all components attached to it. Internal Hardware includes the following: 
    - The **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** is a computer’s main processor, which is used to perform general computing tasks on a computer. The CPU executes the instructions provided by programs, which enables these programs to run. 

    - **Random Access Memory (RAM)** is a hardware component used for short-term memory. It’s where data is stored temporarily as you perform tasks on your computer. The CPU takes the data from RAM to run programs.

    - The **hard drive** is a hardware component used for long-term memory. It’s where programs and files are stored for the computer to access later.


  ## Linux Distributions

  - KALI LINUX
  - Ubuntu
  - Parrot
  - **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** is a subscription-based distribution of Linux built for enterprise use. Red Hat is not free, which is a major difference from the previously mentioned distributions.
  - **CentOS** is an open-source distribution that is closely related to Red Hat.
