#  The User Interface

A **graphical user interface (GUI)** is a user interface that uses icons on the screen to manage different tasks on the computer.   

A **command-line interface (CLI)** is a text-based user interface that uses commands to interact with the computer. 



### Advantages of a CLI

- **Efficiency**  
  Because a CLI can accept multiple requests at one time, itâ€™s more powerful when you need to perform multiple tasks efficiently. For example, if you had to create multiple new files in your system, you could quickly perform this task in a CLI.

- **History File**  
  For security analysts, using the Linux CLI is helpful because it records a history file of all the commands and actions in the CLI. If you were using a GUI, your actions are not necessarily saved in a history file.
