## 3. Network and Network Security

- **Bandwidth:** The maximum data transmission capacity over a network, measured by bits per second.
- **Cloud computing:** The practice of using remote servers, application, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of on local physical devices.
- **Cloud network:** A collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in remote data centers that can be accessed via the internet.
- **Data packet:** A basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network.
- **Hub:** A network device that broadcasts information to every device on the network.
- **Internet Protocol (IP):** A set of standards used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices on a network.
- **Internet Protocol (IP) address:** A unique string of characters that identifies the location of a device on the internet.
- **Local Area Network (LAN):** A network that spans small areas like an office building, a school, or a home.
- **Media Access Control (MAC) address:** A unique alphanumeric identifier that is assigned to each physical device on a network.
- **Modem:** A device that connects your router to the internet and brings internet access to the LAN.
- **Network:** A group of connected devices.
- **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model:** A standardized concept that describes the seven layers computers use to communicate and send data over the network.
- **Packet sniffing:** The practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network.
- **Port:** A software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network.
- **Router:** A network device that connects multiple networks together.
- **Speed:** The rate at which a device sends and receives data, measured by bits per second.
- **Switch:** A device that makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them.
- **TCP/IP model:** A framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across a network.
- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** An internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data.
- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP):** A connectionless protocol that does not establish a connection between devices before transmissions.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN):** A network that spans a large geographic area like a city, state, or country.


- **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):** A network protocol used to determine the MAC address of the next router or device on the path

- **Network protocols:** A set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery of data and the structure of data
- **Network segmentation:** A security technique that divides the network into segments
- **Port filtering:** A firewall function that blocks or allows certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication
- **Proxy server:** A server that fulfills the requests of its clients by forwarding them to other servers
- **Reverse proxy server:** A server that regulates and restricts the internet's access to an internal server
- **Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP):** A secure protocol used to transfer files from one device to another over a network
- **Secure shell (SSH):** A security protocol used to create a shell with a remote system
- **Security zone:** A segment of a company’s network that protects the internal network from the internet
- **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP):** A network protocol used for monitoring and managing devices on a network
- **Stateful:** A class of firewall that keeps track of information passing through it and proactively filters out threats
- **Stateless:** A class of firewall that operates based on predefined rules and does not keep track of information from data packets
- **Subnetting:** The subdivision of a network into logical groups called subnets
- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** An internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data
