# Into into Nmap

Every computer has a total of 65535 available ports, out of which ports from 0 to 1023 are considered to be well-known ports, 
meaning they are typically reserved for specific services or applications and used by protocls like HTTPS, SSH, SMTP etc.

**Nmap**is a powerful tool that can be used to perform  many different types of port scan.
Its scripting engine can also be use to scan for vulnerabilities, and in some cases even perform the exploit directly!
