### Variables 

A variable can be thought of as an object that holds data that can be changed.
There are also variables that don't change, called **Constants**.

All variables are stored in memory somewhere, and their declarations allow the compiler
to organize this memory more efficiently. Despite all of the variable type declarations, everything is all just memory.

```bash
int a = 13, b;
float k;
char z = 'A';
k = 3.14;
z = 'w';
b = a + 5;
```
