# Literals

**A literal is data whose values are determined by the literal itself.**  

For example, set of digits:
```
231  
```
The value it represent is __two hundred and thrity one__

And lets say, the following:
```
c
```
There are many possibilities "c" might represent; maybe the speed of light, or the constanct of integrations or others.
It itself doesn't represent any value.

So **"231" is a literal and, "c" is not.**

We use literals **to encode data and to put them into our code**.  

For example: 
```
print("2")   // a string literal
print(2)    //  an integer literal
```



### Integer
Numbers handled by modern computers are mainly of two types:  

- **integers**, that is, those which are devoid of the fractional part;
- and **floating-point numbers (or simply floats)**, that contain (or are able to contain) the fractional part

Both of these kinds of numbers differ significantly in how they're stored in a computer memory and in the range of acceptable values.

The characteristic of the numeric value which determines its kind, range, and application, is called the **type**.

## Strings

Technically, array of characters. An __array__ is list of *n* elements of same data type.
Arrays also referred to as **buffers**.
